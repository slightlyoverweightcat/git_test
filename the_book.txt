This is a story about a giant cucumber who was scared of cats
One day Giant Green Cucumber went out for a walk and stumbled upon a cat.
Orange cat was big and fluffy and was eating a big plate of pasta.
Cucumber was wondering what the cat was doing. Cucumber was wondering what the cat was.
Cucumber has never seen a cat before and the whole scene seemed weird to Cucumber.
At some point the cat finished the pasta, all the while Cucumber was watching it.
Once the cat was done, it look at the Cucumber and said:
"You look like the bell pepper. I will eat you."
Cucumber wasn't quite ready to be eaten so he decided to make a run for it.
Cucumber flipped cat's empty pasta plate and the leftover sauce went flying all over the place.
Cat screamed:
"You madman and brute! You will pay for this!"
But it was too late - Cucumber managed to slip into a crack in the wall, while the cat was recovering from it's shock.
